waterfall is direct while agile one can make changes anywhere in the methodolgy

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
software develpoer writes the code
engineer checks it meets criteria
manager checks it accomplishes the task

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
